First GitHub

Hello GitHub! 

I am new to this world of branching, editing, and pulling code from GitHub. 
So here I am learning and practicing the knowledge of GitHub for when I have to use it in the future. 


Hi Katie, it's Denny. I got your invitation to collaberate. Hopefully you have a beautiful day!
